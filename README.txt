### INTERCEPTORS ###
By Joey, Harrison, Kathy and Rui

A Game Design project for CS 437 at William & Mary,
Interceptors is a top-down arcade style shoot-em-up
with roots in Galaga, Ikaruga, and Ace Combat.

Dodge the fast-moving, tricky screamers, destroy
the bulky, frontline bogeys, and send the alien
flagship crashing to the ground.

Stake your claim as the greatest pilot to fly!
